## Notes for teaching jekyll.

Assumes that you can find command line and that you have [atom](https://atom.io/) or another text editor that shows directory trees and makes things in nice colors.

This is not a tutorial for "easiest way to get Jekyll up and running." Instead, it's about getting to know how jekyll works.

### Installing jekyll

#### For macs

1. Open Terminal
1. Try installing basic jekyll site using the commands at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/).
1. Open a new project in Atom and import your new directory.

#### For Windows
1. Closely follow all of the instructions on [installing jekyll on windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/) based on which Windows Operating system you use.
1. Open a new project in Atom and import your new directory.

Pause here to make sure everything works. Troubleshoot.
Now, into how and why it works. Also, what is [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

### Looking around jekyll

1. On your page, navigate to the about page.
1. Go to the about.md file in atom and make a change. Check out the changes to the page.
1. Now, CTRL C to stop your server, and type "jekyll build".  
1. Take a look at the site folder. Zip it up and move it to your web folder on reclaim.

### Digging a little deeper

This jekyll site is built using a tem. At the [Jekyll Theme Page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) you can see how they're hiding some of the directories from immediate view.
1. Show my repo that has all of the theme folders copied from where my computer stored the gem for minima, change some things, and show "jekyll build" with changes to site files.
